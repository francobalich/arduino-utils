# Arduino Utils

A collection of practical and well-documented Arduino examples, focused on sensors, actuators, and serial communication.

## 📦 Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following categories:

### Sensors
- Temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11/DHT22)
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Light intensity sensor (LDR)
- Motion sensor (PIR)
- Gyroscope (MPU6050)

### Actuators
- Servo motor control
- DC motor control with L298N

### Communication
- Serial port (monitoring and debug)
